You say you\u2019re trying to analyze and analyze and analyze what, \u201cwhat lack in me?\u201d or \u201cyou know what lack in me?\u2019 I guess your asking yourself mostly, \u201cWhat lack in me keeps,  keeps me from having a lasting  relationship with men?\u201d\nClient: Yes, if I do all these things for a man, so then he\u2019ll want me.\nTherapist: But that her saying that  he saying that,  uh, really does touch something in you. \u201cIs there something wrong with me  that I....\u201c\nClient: Or wanting to do it.   And then I... another question, hard question, I ask myself is, \u201cWell, I\u2019m choosing men to relate to that don\u2019t know how to give in the way that I want to be given to.\u201d  And then I try  to figure that one out.  \u201cOh simple, I\u2019m choosing, that just means I need to choose differently.\u201d  And then I look around and it doesn\u2019t seem so simple.\nTherapist: Mhm. It,  it wouldn\u2019t bother you that much, or you wouldn\u2019t think so much about it if there wasn\u2019t something in you that that refers to.\nClient: And one thing that now I\u2019m recalling that really frightened me was I was talking- I lived with my husband for eight years  and I felt rejected by him and I left him.  And I left him for a man I was very much in love with that I\u2019ve been very close to  for five years. But he\u2019s also... like, I moved away from him but I felt left  by him also. And so this man friend of mine said to me, \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with you that you can\u2019t keep a man?\u201d And that, uh, that really scared me inside because when I look at the situation in a practical, sensible way that doesn\u2019t seem like reality.  But then I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s true.\nTherapist: You\u2019re saying, \u201cMaybe, maybe I\u2019m just following the same pattern as my mother.\u201d\nClient: That I don\u2019t see.  And, and, uh, just the fact that it touched me so much shows me that there\u2019s something there.\nTherapist: ", "completion": " So you can have good times and all that, but still there is this nagging question or these nagging questions, \u201cAm I just following my mother\u2019s pattern?\u201d \u201cWhat is wrong with me that I don\u2019t have a permanent relationship with a man?\u201d<end>"}
