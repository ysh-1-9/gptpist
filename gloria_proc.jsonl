But she didn't talk about that.   Maybe that's where I got my picture. I don't know, but I want Pammy to see me as a full woman, but also accept me.\nTherapist: You don't sound so uncertain.\nClient: I don't?  What do you mean?\nTherapist: What I mean is you have been sitting there telling me just what you would like to do in that relationship with Pam.\nClient:  I would, but I don't want to quite take the risk of doing it  unless an authority tells me that ...\nTherapist:  It\u2019s, I guess one thing that I feel very keenly is that it's an awful risky thing to live.
