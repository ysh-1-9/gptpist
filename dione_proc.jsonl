And, but at the same time, like, in a way, in a way, I used to feel that I put myself in that position. Because no one knew what was happening inside of me, you see. Because I had to take care of myself. And I had to be better than everybody else. Because I was always told that. You can, in a majority society I had to be 100, 200 percent better than my white counterpart  or my brown counterpart,  or whatever. I had to do that, because that's what it took to survive .\nTherapist: Mhm, hmm.

Um, I gave up my, my job and came out here, and I did consultant work and so forth, but I had to use a great deal of money for diagnosticians or  whatever and, and, and all kinds of little gimmicks to keep me alive.  And consequently I had to borrow money. And when I borrowed that money, I didn't borrow it in a way that would say to you like, \"Hey, uh, Ted or whatever, I need, you know X amount of dollars, you know, and like . . .
